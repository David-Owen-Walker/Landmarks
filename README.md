Fork of the CPHDH LandmarkBuilder project meant to expose the Landmarks via Omeka's rest API

The purpose of the modifications is to make this plugin appropriate for use with a mobile application. 
This means that the landmarks will be exposed over omeka's rest api, and that more capacity for sorting
will be added to the server. In particular, landmarks can be sorted according to distance from a point.
